## Type Conversion and Type Casting (implicit & explicit)

---

Type casting is a **common operation** in Java. This process is categorized  
into **two main types**:

---

## 1. Type Conversion (Widening Conversion / Implicit Casting)

### Definition
Widening conversion occurs **automatically** when a **smaller data type**  
is assigned to a **larger data type**. Since there is **no risk of data loss**,  
Java handles it implicitly.

### Widening Order
```
byte → short → char → int → long → float → double
```

### ✅ Characteristics
- No data loss
- Performed automatically
- Also called **implicit casting** or **type conversion**

### Code Walkthrough
```java
byte b = 10;
short s = b;     // byte to short
int i = s;       // short to int
long l = i;      // int to long
float f = l;     // long to float
double d = f;    // float to double
```

### Output
```text
Byte: 10
Short: 10
Int: 10
Long: 10
Float: 10.0
Double: 10.0
```

---

## 2. Type Casting (Narrowing Conversion / Explicit Casting)

### Definition
Narrowing conversion is used when a **larger data type** is converted into  
a **smaller one**. This must be done **manually** using a cast operator  
because there is a **possibility of data loss**.

### Narrowing Order
```
double → float → long → int → char → short → byte
```

### ✅ Characteristics
- Possible data loss
- Must be explicitly cast
- Also known as **explicit casting** or **type casting**

### Code Walkthrough
```java
double d2 = 9.78;
float f2 = (float) d2;   // double to float
long l2 = (long) f2;     // float to long
int i2 = (int) l2;       // long to int
short s2 = (short) i2;   // int to short
byte b2 = (byte) s2;     // short to byte
```

### Output
```text
Double: 9.78
Float: 9.78
Long: 9
Int: 9
Short: 9
Byte: 9
```

---

## 3. Type Casting with Characters

Characters in Java are represented using **ASCII / Unicode values**.

You can convert:
- `char → int` (gives ASCII value)
- `int → char` (gives character for ASCII value)

### Example
```java
char c = 'A';
int charToInt = c;             // 65
char intToChar = (char) 65;    // 'A'
```

### Output
```text
Character: A
Character to Int: 65
Int to Character: A
```

---

## 4. Type Conversion with Strings (Parsing)

Strings **cannot be type-cast directly** into numeric types.  
Instead, Java provides **parsing methods**.

### Common Methods
```text
Integer.parseInt("123")      → int
Double.parseDouble("123.45") → double
```

### Example
```java
String str = "123";
int strToInt = Integer.parseInt(str);
double strToDouble = Double.parseDouble(str);
```

### Output
```text
String to Int: 123
String to Double: 123.0
```

---

## 5. Type Conversion with Booleans

### Important
Java **does not allow** conversion between `boolean` and any other data type.

```java
boolean bool = true;
// int x = (int) bool; ❌ Not allowed
```

### Output
```text
Boolean: true
```

---

## Summary Table: Parsing vs Type Conversion

| Feature | Parsing | Type Conversion |
|------|--------|----------------|
| Purpose | Convert String → Data Type | Convert One Type → Another |
| Use | Reading input (files, APIs, user input) | Working with numeric types |
| Method | `parseXxx()` (e.g., Integer.parseInt) | Implicit or explicit casting |
| Data Loss Risk | No | Possible (in narrowing) |
| Example | `"123"` → `123` | `10.5` → `10` |

---

## ✅ Best Practices (Type Casting)
- Use **widening conversions** whenever possible
- Use **explicit casting** only when value range is guaranteed
- Use **parsing** for string-based numeric input
- Be cautious with **booleans** (no casting allowed)

---

## Type Promotion in Java

### What is Type Promotion?
Type promotion is the **automatic conversion** of smaller data types to  
larger data types during **arithmetic or binary operations**.

---

### Why It Happens?
Java promotes smaller types to larger types to ensure:
- No loss of precision
- Correct mathematical results

---

### Example Code
```java
int x = 10;
float y = 5.5f;
float result = x + y; // int is promoted to float
```

### What Happens Internally?
- `x` is an `int`
- `y` is a `float`
- `x` is promoted to `float`
- Operation becomes:
```java
float result = (float) x + y;
```

### Output
```text
Type Promotion:
Int: 10
Float: 5.5
Result of Int + Float: 15.5
```

---

## Type Promotion Hierarchy (Low → High)
```
byte → short → int → long → float → double
```
> Note: `char` is promoted to `int` during arithmetic operations.

---

## More Examples
```java
byte a = 40;
byte b = 50;
byte c = 100;

int result = a * b / c; // byte promoted to int

char ch = 'A';
int ascii = ch + 1; // 'A' = 65 → result = 66
```

---

## Important Notes
- `byte`, `short`, and `char` are **always promoted to int** in arithmetic
- You cannot assign `byte + byte` directly to a byte without casting

---

## ✅ Best Practices (Type Promotion)
- Be aware of type promotion in expressions
- Always check result data types
- Use explicit casting only when necessary
