## Naming Conventions in Java

---
**Naming conventions** are a set of rules and best practices used to name  
variables, methods, classes, packages, and other identifiers in Java.  
Following naming conventions improves **readability, consistency, and  
maintainability** of the code.

---

## 1. Package Naming Convention
- Package names are written in **lowercase letters**
- Usually based on the **reversed domain name**

**Example:**
```java
com.companyname.projectname.module
```

---

## 2. Class Naming Convention
- Class names use **PascalCase (UpperCamelCase)**
- First letter of each word is **capitalized**
- Nouns are preferred

**Example:**
```java
Student
BankAccount
EmployeeDetails
```

---

## 3. Interface Naming Convention
- Same as class names → **PascalCase**
- Often describes a capability

**Example:**
```java
Runnable
Comparable
Serializable
```

---

## 4. Method Naming Convention
- Method names use **camelCase**
- First letter is **lowercase**
- Verbs are preferred

**Example:**
```java
calculateSalary()
printDetails()
getName()
```

---

## 5. Variable Naming Convention
- Variable names use **camelCase**
- First letter is **lowercase**
- Meaningful and descriptive names should be used

**Example:**
```java
int age;
double totalAmount;
String studentName;
```

---

## 6. Constant Naming Convention
- Constants use **UPPERCASE letters**
- Words separated using **underscore (_)**

**Example:**
```java
static final double PI = 3.14159;
static final int MAX_LIMIT = 100;
```

---

## 7. Enum Naming Convention
- Enum names follow **PascalCase**
- Enum constants use **UPPERCASE**

**Example:**
```java
enum Day {
    MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY
}
```

---

## 8. Boolean Naming Convention
- Boolean variables often start with:
    - `is`
    - `has`
    - `can`

**Example:**
```java
boolean isActive;
boolean hasAccess;
boolean canVote;
```

---

## 9. File Naming Convention
- Java source file name must match the **public class name**

**Example:**
```java
public class Student { }
