## **Variables & Constants**

--- 
### **1. Variables**
**Variables** are **containers that store data in memory**.  
A variable is used to **initialize and store data** that can change during  
program execution.

---

## **Key Components of Variables in Java**
A variable in Java has **three components**:

- **Data Type** – Defines the type of data stored  
  *(e.g., `int`, `float`, `double`, `String`)*
- **Variable Name** – A unique identifier that follows Java naming rules
- **Value** – The actual data assigned to the variable

**Example:**
```java
int age = 25;
```

In this example:
- `int` is the **data type**
- `age` is the **variable name**
- `25` is the **value** assigned to the variable

## **Types of Variables in Java**

There are **three types of variables** in Java:

---

### **1. Local Variables**
- Declared **inside a method, constructor, or block**
- Created when the method is **invoked**
- Destroyed when the method **execution ends**
- **Must be initialized** before use
- **No default value**

**Example:**
```java
void display() {
    int count = 10; // local variable
}
```

### **2. Instance Variables**
- Declared **inside a class but outside any method**
- Created when an **object of the class is instantiated**
- Destroyed when the object is **destroyed**
- **Default values** are assigned if not initialized
- Accessible by all methods in the class
- Each object has its **own copy** of instance variables
- Used to store **object-specific data**

**Example:**
```java
class Student {
    int rollNumber; // instance variable
}
```
### **3. Static Variables (Class Variables)**
- Declared with the **`static`** keyword inside a class but outside any method
- Created when the **class is loaded** into memory
- Destroyed when the class is **unloaded**
- **Default values** are assigned if not initialized
- Shared among **all instances** of the class
- Used to store **class-level data**
- Memory allocation is done only once

**Example:**
```java
class Counter {
    static int count = 0; // static variable
    static String name = "Akash Kobal"; 
}
```

---
## **2. Constants**
**Constants** are **fixed values that cannot be changed** during program execution.  
In Java, constants are defined using the **`final`** keyword.   
Once a constant is assigned a value, it **cannot be modified**.

**Example:**
```java
final double PI = 3.14159;
```
In this example, `PI` is a constant with a value of `3.14159`.

### Difference Between Variables and Constants
| **Variables**                     | **Constants**                         |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Can change value during execution | Value cannot be changed once assigned |
| Declared normally                 | Declared with `final` keyword         |
| Used to store dynamic data        | Used to store fixed values            |
| Example: `int age = 25;`          | Example: `final double PI             |

### Key Points to Remember
- Use **variables** to store data that may change.
- Use **constants** for values that should remain unchanged.
- Java provides local, instance, and static variables.
- Always follow naming conventions for better code readability.
