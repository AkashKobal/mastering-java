## Basics of Computer Programming:
Computer programming is the process of instructing computers to perform tasks.
It involves writing code in various programming languages to create software applications, websites, and other digital
solutions.

### In short, a program is a set of instructions.

### Why do we need to Learn Any Programming Language?
A computer or any programmable device understands machine language because the computer works on electricity and
electricity works on binary numbers (0 and 1). We humans only understand natural language. To fulfill this gap between
humans and computers programming language is introduced.

### What happens if either human understands machine language, or a machine understands natural language?
If that happens then we don't need to know any programming language to give instructions to machines and anyone
can be a programmer if that situation happens.

#### Key Concepts:
1. Programming Languages: Common languages include Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript.
2. Syntax: The set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols considered to be correctly structured programs in
a language.
3. Variables: Used to store data that can be changed during program execution.
4. Control Structures: Include conditionals (if-else statements) and loops (for, while) to control the flow of the
program.
5. Functions: Reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks.
6. Data Structures: Ways to organize and store data, such as arrays, lists, and dictionaries.
7. Debugging: The process of identifying and fixing errors in the code.
8. Version Control: Tools like Git help manage changes to code over time.

### Programming Methods
There are three programming methodologies so far mostly used.
1. Monolithic Programming
2. Modular/Procedural Programming
3. Object-Oriented Programming

- Monolithic Programming: It was practiced when programming was just introduced. In monolithic programming, everything from code, data, and instruction, is in a single file which makes it difficult to review the code. We are not reusing the code. 
- Modular/ Procedural Programming: Procedural programming helps to divide the work among a team, and we also use function so that it allows for to reuse of the code. Data and function are used separately. 
- Object Oriented Programming: OOPs are widely used in industries, we take data and functions together and created them as a class.

### What is an Algorithm?
An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or formula for solving a problem. It is a set of instructions that are followed
to perform a specific task or solve a particular problem. Algorithms are used in computer programming to create efficient and effective solutions to various problems.

### What is a Computer?
A computer is an electronic device that takes input from the user, processes it, and gives results or responds as 
per the user. The computer is a programmable computational device.

### The components of a computer are:
1. Input Devices: Tools like keyboards and mice that allow users to input data into the computer.
2. Output Devices: Monitors and printers that display or produce the results of computer processing.
3. Central Processing Unit (CPU): The brain of the computer that performs calculations and executes instructions.

CPU is known as the brain of the computer system. All the operations within the system are supervised & controlled by the CPU.
It interprets and coordinates the instructions. The CPU control all internal & external devices, perform arithmetic 
and logical operation, controls memory usage, and control the sequence of operation.

### Performing all these operations the CPU has 3 sub-units:
1. Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU): Responsible for performing all arithmetic and logical operations.
2. Control Unit (CU): Directs the operation of the processor. It tells the computer's memory, ALU, and input/output 
devices how to respond to the instructions that have been sent to the processor.
3. Memory Unit: Stores data and instructions that the CPU needs to access quickly.
