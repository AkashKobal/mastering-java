## **Basics of Computer Programming**

**Computer programming** is the process of instructing computers to perform tasks.  
It involves writing code in various **programming languages** to create **software applications, websites, and digital solutions**.

### **In short, a program is a set of instructions.**

### **Why do we need to Learn Any Programming Language?**
A computer or any programmable device understands **machine language**, because a computer works on **electricity** and electricity works on **binary numbers (0 and 1)**.  
We humans only understand **natural languages**. To bridge the gap between humans and computers, a **programming language** is introduced.

---

### **What happens if either humans understand machine language, or machines understand natural language?**
If that happens, then we **would not need to learn any programming language** to give instructions to machines, and **anyone could become a programmer**.

### **Key Concepts**
1. **Programming Languages:** Common languages include **Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript**.
2. **Syntax:** A set of rules that defines how programs must be written to be understood by a language.
3. **Variables:** Used to store data that can change during program execution.
4. **Control Structures:** Include **conditionals (if-else)** and **loops (for, while)** to control program flow.
5. **Functions:** Reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks.
6. **Data Structures:** Ways to organize and store data such as **arrays, lists, and dictionaries**.
7. **Debugging:** The process of identifying and fixing errors in code.
8. **Version Control:** Tools like **Git** help manage code changes over time.

### **Programming Methods**
There are three major programming methodologies commonly used:

1. **Monolithic Programming**
2. **Modular / Procedural Programming**
3. **Object-Oriented Programming**

- **Monolithic Programming:**  
  Used in early programming days. All code, data, and logic exist in a **single file**, making it difficult to maintain and reuse.

- **Modular / Procedural Programming:**  
  Divides work into functions, enabling **code reuse** and **team collaboration**. Data and functions are maintained separately.

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**  
  Widely used in industry. Data and functions are combined into **classes**, improving reusability, scalability, and maintenance.

### **What is an Algorithm?**
An **algorithm** is a **step-by-step procedure** used to solve a problem or perform a task.  
Algorithms help create **efficient and optimized solutions** in programming.

---

### **What is a Computer?**
A **computer** is an **electronic device** that takes input from the user, processes it, and produces output based on given instructions.  
It is a **programmable computational device**.

---

### **The Components of a Computer**
1. **Input Devices:** Keyboard, mouse, etc., used to provide input.
2. **Output Devices:** Monitor, printer, etc., used to display results.
3. **Central Processing Unit (CPU):** The brain of the computer.

---

### **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**
The **CPU** supervises and controls all operations of the computer system. It:
- Executes instructions
- Performs arithmetic and logical operations
- Controls memory usage
- Manages internal and external devices

---

### **CPU Sub-Units**
The CPU consists of three major units:

1. **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):**  
   Performs arithmetic calculations and logical operations.

2. **Control Unit (CU):**  
   Directs system operations and controls how data flows between CPU, memory, and I/O devices.

3. **Memory Unit:**  
   Stores data and instructions required for immediate processing.
